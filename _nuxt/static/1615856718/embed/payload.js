I think most of the country was feeling that, no matter what profession you had. Specifically, for teachers, I think there is a lot of worry about ‘Are we going to be able to teach over the computer?’ and more importantly, ‘Are we going to be able to support the social and emotional skills that students are still developing?’\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt's my first year teaching kindergarten, and I’m learning how short their attention spans are and how engaging the lessons need to be for them to kind of get hooked in it. Some of my roommates teach middle school, and I'm finding it way easier to engage the kindergartners just because I can be silly. I sing songs in the morning, do greetings and just make it as engaging as possible. And all of them have their cameras on. No one is shy about showing up every day.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWe're working on those everyday tech issues, which are frustrating, but the kids are pretty resilient, and they’re figuring out a way to participate, even if nobody can hear what they're saying. Some of the kids got Chromebooks that are super old. So when you unmute that student who has that, it's like this crazy audio sound that's kind of hard to decipher.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI definitely feel bad that we're not able to be in the classroom because I think they're definitely missing out on a lot of those skills like learning how to take turns well, sharing and just being near a bunch of kids. That piece is definitely harder to convey over Zoom, especially for kids who don't have siblings. I can tell a lot of them are like missing out on that.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI mostly miss seeing the older kids that I taught in the past or the kids that are always around the building. I’ve visited one of their Zooms before, but it's very different from popping into their classroom. So that bigger community I miss, but we're doing a talent show with the whole community. We do like weekly school assemblies, so there are brief moments to see each other, but it's definitely not the same.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"mh0 ph0 pv3 f4 f3-ns bt bb bw4 b--black\"\u003E\u003Cp class=\"ph3 fw7 lh-1-2 lh-title-ns\"\u003E“In some ways, though, there's a little silver lining.

The two women stayed out of the kitchen completely. The grandmother and siblings would cook meals and leave the food outside their bedroom doors. Because all of the family members share one bathroom in the house, everyone also had to be extra cautious about cleaning and sanitizing.&nbsp;\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote class=\"mh0 ph0 pv3 f4 f3-ns bt bb bw4 b--black\"\u003E\u003Cp class=\"ph3 fw7 lh-1-2 lh-title-ns\"\u003E“It's hard.

But in rural communities like Tranquility where I live, closing the digital divide is much more difficult. One solution my school district proposed at the start of the pandemic was to add Wi-Fi to buses and roll them to areas around the community. But even then, they were not reaching every home. Students had to go to the buses to get internet access, but when temperatures reached 100 degrees and as COVID-19 started spreading, it was a problem.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere were times it was frustrating because I didn’t know what was happening in my classes. I turned to my classmates to keep me updated and to teach me the material. My friends and I had to become our own teachers. This routine of me asking my friends went on for about two weeks. We would call each other to go over the material, and they would share their notes with me through Snapchat.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took about a month and a half after distance learning began for us to receive our hot spot.
